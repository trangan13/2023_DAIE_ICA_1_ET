    "text": "Interpretation\n\nBudget vs. Success\nThe coefficient for Budget is approximately -8.64e-07 with a p-value of 0.105437. This coefficient suggests a negative relationship between the budget and the success rate of a project. However, the p-value is greater than 0.05, which indicates that this relationship is not statistically significant.\nPlot: The negative slope seen in the plot reflects the negative coefficient of the budget in the model. However, given the lack of statistical significance, this trend should be interpreted cautiously. It suggests that higher budgets might not necessarily lead to higher success rates, but the evidence isn’t strong enough to firmly conclude that higher budgets negatively impact success.\nTeam Size vs. Success\nThe coefficient for TeamSize is 0.1201 with a p-value of 0.000438, which is highly significant. This indicates a clear positive relationship between team size and success rate. The P-value is lower than .05 which suggest there is statistical significance to this result.\nPlot: The positive slope aligns with the significant positive coefficient for team size. This visualization reinforces the model’s finding: larger teams are associated with higher success rates in projects. The strength of this relationship is underscored by both the steepness of the slope in the plot and the statistical significance in the model results."

    "section": "Discussion",
    "text": "Discussion\nOverall we can gather some insight from the linear regression model and the plots, in order to determine how budget and teamsize influences success in a project, but it is important to consider that the source of data is quite limited. There is also a lot to say about the measure of success selected to run the model. From the data provided I could only opt to determine success through the completion or not completion of a project, but I am uncertain that can be considered a valid data point for linear regression. The data is limited to a 0 or a 1 in this exercise, so we cannot fully consider it linearly related to the outcome."

    "text": "In this project, I ventured into a few of the long suite of powerful R packages to enhance the data analysis visualization capabilities. Initially, I utilized the ‘scales’ package for effectively managing numerical data in plots and making sure the budget and team sizes were presented in an easily interpretable manner. The ‘reactable’ package was simple to use and brought in an interactive and visually appealing dimension to the tables. Furthermore, the ‘maps’ package was used as an exercise to bring in a different kind of data visualization, this geospatial data representation enabled the visualization of the distribution of project budgets across different countries in Europe. For some reason the map does look jagged, but I was unable to identify the source or bring to a solution, something left to continue practicing with and learning about. Overall I have found the capabilities of R and its packages quite fun to explore."

    "text": "As this data project comes to a close, I find myself reflecting on the challenges and learning. Delving into SQL querying for the first time was a testing task. Grasping the language and logic in order to formulate the queries was the main part of this learning experience. The process was laborious, time consuming and sometimes frustrating, but ultimately it was rewarding and it is something I would like to continue learning.\nLinear regression was also a concept a found interesting to explore. Understanding the relationship between variables and how they impact outcomes was particularly useful, I would have also enjoyed practicing with data that provided a bit more play to discover real insight, but the exercise was good.\nI have opted to not complete Part C of the assesstment. Although I have no doubt learning about Shiny Applications is incredibly valuable, I have found the challenge of completing this part of the project to be satisfying enough and I am ready to conclude the focus on this topic for now. I do really appreacciate the detailed guidelines and videos made to guide us and hope to learn this sometime in the future.\nThe application of these skills in the world of game development and computer animation is exciting. SQL querying and data analysis has shown me how this powerful tools are accessible to me and how important they are to make truly educated decisions.\nOverall, working with R has been a fun and enriching experience. The tools and methodologies I’ve learned have have sparked a keen interest in further exploring their application in game development and computer animation. The journey through this project, though arduous, has been a stepping stone in my continuous learning path in data analytics, one that I am sure I will continue."
