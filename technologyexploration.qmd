In this project, I ventured into a few of the long suite of powerful R packages to enhance the data analysis visualization capabilities. Initially, I utilized the 'scales' package for effectively managing numerical data in plots and making sure the budget and team sizes were presented in an easily interpretable manner. The 'reactable' package was simple to use and brought in an interactive and visually appealing dimension to the tables. Furthermore, the 'maps' package was used as an exercise to bring in a different kind of data visualization, this geospatial data representation enabled the visualization of the distribution of project budgets across different countries in Europe. For some reason the map does look jagged, but I was unable to identify the source or bring to a solution, something left to continue practicing with and learning about. Overall I have found the capabilities of R and its packages quite fun to play with.
